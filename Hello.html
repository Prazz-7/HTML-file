    <h1>Paragraph</h1>
    <p>
      In recent years, many people have become increasingly aware of the need
      for physical fitness.* Almost everywhere people turn, whether it is to a
      newsstand, television or billboard,* advise for guarding and improving
      health bombards them. Although much of this advice is commercially
      motivated by those eager to sell vitamins, natural foods and reducing
      gimmicks,* some of it, especially those advocating a regular exercise
      program, merits serious attention. Such a program, if it consists of at
      least 30 minutes three times a week and if a personâ€™s physician approves
      it,* provides numerous benefits. Regular exercise releases tension,
      improves appearance, and increases stamina.
