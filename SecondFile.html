      * The introduction begins with a broad view of physical fitness generally,
      but also engages the reader by connecting with general experience. *
      Notice that the writer reaches past the general “Almost everywhere people
      turn” to the more specific and concrete “newsstand, television, or
      billboard.” * Again notice the specifics—not just “to sell products” or
      “to sell stuff.” The specifics make the idea more convincing and create
      more associations for the reader.Notice how the introduction is a good
      place to present background, definitions and limitations that affect the
      thesis and topic generally. *By placing the thesis at the end of the
      introduction, the writer not only makes the main point clear and emphatic,
      but also makes sure that the essay’s main point is uppermost in the
      reader’s mind as the reader begins the body of the essay.
