      *This sentence offers the paragraph’s idea (release of tension), renews
      the essay idea (these benefits), and alerts the reader to the underlying
      logic of the arrangement of main ideas (“is immediate” suggests to the
      reader that the essay will follow a chronological order, the order in
      which the benefits become available.) * Notice the specifics in the next
      two sentences—specific activities and benefits. Notice how the general
      term,” petty irritations and frustrations” is followed by specific
      examples. *This closing sentence reinforces both the main paragraph and
      the essay idea.
