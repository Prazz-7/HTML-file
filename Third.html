    <h3>Paragraph 2</h3>
    <p>
      The first of these benefits, the release of tension, is immediate.*
      Tension builds in the body because of an over accumulation of adrenaline
      produced by stress, anxiety, or fear.* Doctors agree that performing
      calisthenics or participating in an active sport such as tennis or
      volleyball for 30 minutes releases tension. If a person swims, jogs, or
      rides a bicycle for half that time, he or she should sleep better at night
      and have a better temperament the next day. In addition, after the release
      of tension, petty irritations and frustrations should be less troubling.*
      For example, an employee upset by the dayâ€™s work and by traffic congestion
      may rush home, argue with the family, and eat excessively. Taking about 30
      minutes to release frustration through physical exercise could help the
      person to avoid this behavior. Planned physical exercise, therefore, can
      eliminate, or at least control, tension.
